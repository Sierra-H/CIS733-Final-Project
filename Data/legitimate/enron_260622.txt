We just have been asked to review on an expedited basis all material contracts of ENE and ENA for change-of-control type provisions.  Please let us know what contracts or guidance you may have or know of; we need to begin reviewing/collecting information ASAP, i.e., this weekend.  If you know of someone who should receive this e-mail but who has not, please forward.  You may contact me at any of the below numbers.  

Thanks for your help.

Regards, NJD
