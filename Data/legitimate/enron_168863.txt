Subject:	FERC to discuss all East proposed RTOs

FERC's agenda for its 10/24/01 meeting includes "Discussion of RTO Developments" for the Northeast, Southeast (of interest, the agenda does not include the GridFlorida docket) and Midwest.  The agenda also includes separate docketed items:

-- Reliability, Security and Market Operations
-- Electricity Market Design and Structure

Claudette, TJ and Ginger -- can you please forward to your groups?  Thanks.
