Please forward to North American group:


              I'd encourage everyone in the group to leave early today, if you so desire,  in order to more fully enjoy celebrating Halloween with families and friends. Thanks also  for your continued support and dedication during these difficult times - It is noticed and much appreciated.  Enjoy Halloween!
