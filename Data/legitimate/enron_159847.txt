It appears that the following directory has been moved from the "O:\Legal" directory without prior notification to the Legal department.  We need your assistance restoring this directory back to O:\Legal immediately.   Debra Perlingere is also reporing this problem to the Resolution Center.   However, if someone has requested these records to be moved to a different location, please do notify us and provide us with name and details so that we may contact that him/her directly.

Thanks.

Can you help with restoring the AEP employee directories to the legal file?  There are drafts of agreements currently being negotiated that are needed.

 Thanks
