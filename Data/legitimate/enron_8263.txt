1000 transactions a day in metals is almost true.  Too bad steel is not a metal and we do zero trades a day in that.  We also do not live and die by the bid offer spread.  We make literally no money on that spread.  That is purely there to manage making the market.  The money is in other things that we probably don't want to get in to with a publication.  I liked the very last sentance.  It was the "have your cake and eat it too."

Other than that, it was OK.

What are your thoughts?
