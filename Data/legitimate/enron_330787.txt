Attached is a revised version of TW's response to the CPUC's protest. This version reflects comments received from Teb, Mary Kay, Greg and Maria. I apologize that the attachment is not red-lined. I'm having computer problems and have not been able to generate a red-lined version that accurately tracks the changes.
