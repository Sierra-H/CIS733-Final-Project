Your new Associate is here and currently participating in orientation.  He/She will be ready to join your business unit on Wednesday, August 15, 2001 at 12:00pm.  Please plan to pick up your new Associate at the Doubletree Hotel (conference room - Granger A&B).  Lunch will not be provided as part of orientation on the 15th so you may want to take him/her to lunch and introduce your team.

Please respond to Karen Davis at ext 5-8327 that you will be available to pick up the Associate or provide her with the name of a representative from your business unit that will be attending in your place.

Thanks,
Analyst & Associate Program
