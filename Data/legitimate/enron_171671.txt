As a reminder...there are several pieces of equipment that are set up on the 30th Floor, as well as on our floor, for the Disaster Recovery Team.  PLEASE DO NOT TAKE, BORROW OR USE this equipment.  Should you need to use another computer system, other than yours, or make conference calls please work with your Assistant to help find or set up equipment for you to use.

Thanks for your understanding in this matter.
