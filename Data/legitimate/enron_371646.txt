Vince,

Attached I am sending you the instructions for installing PJM Profiler into your machine. Before you start following the instructions, you should create a new folder in which you'll need to put PERL then copy PJM Bid Profiler folder into that new folder. And don't forget to create a shortcut for PJMProfiler2.exe to run it from your desktop. PJM Bid Profiler is located at O:\Research\Sevil\PJM Bid Profiler. Then you can start doing the steps in the instructions. I hope that this works. If it does not, please let me know. 

Thanks,
