Hey, 

I just found the curtailment on our trade sheets.  We didn't have anything directly with Burbank on a preshedule.  I'm having Donald look at the tags to see if they end up sinking with them.  I also notice that the original curtailment is thru HE 1200.  We redirected the length in the NW to PWX.  We also only had 1 obligation, which was to LDWP.  That was re-directed to Malin.  Hope this helps.

Diana-

  We just got a call from Steve at PGE regarding the following:

  There was a scheduled outage on the DC tie on August 4, 2001 that was supposed to run thru HE 12, but that outage actually lasted until HE 16.  
  PGE is saying that we sank at Burbank but that Burbank doesn't want to pay PGE.  
  I'm not sure what this means or how this is our problem, but if you know anything about it, please let me know.
  If you want Steve's extention, it's x7410.

  Thanks,

  Virginia
