Actually Drow, the repeat arteriogram on Grumbles wasn't all for naught.  The
cardiologist probably pocketed $1500 on the deal.  Beware of those guys, they
tend to be"stent happy".  Now urologists, on the other hand, would never take
such advantage.  If we tell you your prostate's gone to shit, that baby
better be coming out of there.  Take it to the bank.  Glad Grumbles' chest
pipes passed muster.

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years ago.
